# Core Integration Phase 1: VS Code Source Analysis

## Goal: Analyze VS Code source structure to prepare for core integration of Apex sidebar, ensuring modularity.

## Task: ~~Generate a basic VS Code extension project structure using `yo code` or manually.~~ (Skipped - Modifying existing Apex extension) [ ]

### Step: ~~Ensure the necessary tools are installed globally via npm. Check if `yo` and `generator-code` are installed. If not, run `npm install -g yo generator-code` in your terminal.~~ [ ]
#### Success Criteria:
- `yo` and `generator-code` npm packages are installed globally and accessible from the terminal.
#### Validation Metrics:
- `yo --version` and `npm list -g generator-code` commands execute successfully and show installed versions.
- `npm install -g yo generator-code` completes without errors if installation was needed.

### Step: ~~Navigate to the directory where you want to create the new extension project. Run the command `yo code` in the terminal to launch the VS Code extension generator.~~ [ ]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `yo code` generator interactive prompts are initiated in the desired parent directory.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Terminal shows the `yo code` generator welcome message and first prompt.
- Current working directory in the terminal is the intended location for the new project.

### Step: ~~Follow the prompts from the `yo code` generator. Select 'New Extension (TypeScript)'. When prompted, provide the following details:~~ [ ]
  - ~~Name: `apex-copilot-interceptor`~~
  - ~~Identifier: `apex-copilot-interceptor`~~
  - ~~Description: `An extension to intercept the GitHub Copilot panel view and replace it with the Apex UI.`~~
  - ~~Initialize git repository: `Yes`~~
  - ~~Bundle the source code with webpack: `No` (for simplicity initially)~~
  - ~~Package manager: `npm`~~
#### Success Criteria:
- The `yo code` generator successfully completes based on the provided inputs.
- A new directory (e.g., `apex-copilot-interceptor`) is created.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Generator output indicates successful creation.
- The new project directory exists.

### Step: ~~After the generator finishes, verify that the basic project structure has been created successfully. List the contents of the root directory and the `src` directory to confirm the presence of key files like `package.json`, `src/extension.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `.vscodeignore`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.~~ [ ]
#### Success Criteria:
- The generated project directory contains the standard files and subdirectories for a basic VS Code TypeScript extension.
#### Validation Metrics:
- File listing (`ls` or `dir`) confirms the presence of `package.json`, `src/`, `tsconfig.json`, etc., in the root.
- File listing confirms the presence of `extension.ts` within the `src/` directory.

### Step: ~~Open the generated project folder in VS Code. Run `npm install` in the integrated terminal to install the initial dependencies defined in `package.json`.~~ [ ]
#### Success Criteria:
- Project dependencies are successfully installed.
- The project is ready for code modification and building.
#### Validation Metrics:
- `npm install` command completes without errors.
- A `node_modules` directory is created within the project folder.

## Task: Configure the Apex extension's `package.json`: Set basic metadata (name, publisher, etc.). (Note: Metadata already exists, no changes needed for this sub-task) [x]

### Step: Open the `package.json` file located in the root directory of the new VS Code extension project you created in the previous step. (Opened `apex/package.json`) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The target `package.json` file (`apex/package.json`) is open in an editor.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Editor shows the content of `apex/package.json`.

### Step: Locate the `name` property within the `package.json` file. Set its value to a unique, lowercase identifier for the extension, such as `apex-copilot-interceptor`. Ensure there are no spaces or uppercase letters. (No change needed) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `name` property exists and has a valid value. (No change performed as per note).
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the `name` property exists and its value meets VS Code requirements (lowercase, no spaces).

### Step: Find the `displayName` property. Set its value to a human-readable name that will be shown in the VS Code UI, for example, `Apex Copilot Interceptor`. (No change needed, kept as "Apex") [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `displayName` property exists and has a suitable value. (No change performed).
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the `displayName` property exists with the value "Apex".

### Step: Update the `description` property with a brief explanation of the extension's purpose. For instance: `Replaces the GitHub Copilot panel with the Apex interface.` (No change needed) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `description` property exists and accurately describes the extension. (No change performed).
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the `description` property exists and has a relevant value.

### Step: Set the `version` property to an initial semantic version number, such as `0.0.1`. (No change needed) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `version` property exists and follows semantic versioning. (No change performed).
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the `version` property exists and its value is a valid SemVer string (e.g., "1.0.0").

### Step: Define the `publisher` property. Use a placeholder value like `your-publisher-id` for now. (Hint: This needs to match your VS Marketplace publisher ID if you intend to publish the extension later). (No change needed) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `publisher` property exists. (No change performed).
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the `publisher` property exists and has a value.

### Step: Specify the compatible VS Code engine version in the `engines` object. Set the `vscode` property to a recent stable version range, for example: `^1.80.0`. (Hint: Check the VS Code Extension API documentation for current recommendations if needed). (No change needed) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `engines.vscode` property exists and specifies a valid VS Code version range. (No change performed).
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the `engines` object and its `vscode` property exist with a valid range string (e.g., "^1.85.0").

### Step: Review the entire `package.json` file to ensure it contains valid JSON syntax after your modifications. Save the file. (Completed implicitly via successful saves) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `package.json` file is syntactically valid JSON.
- All intended metadata is present and correct.
#### Validation Metrics:
- JSON validation/linting passes on the file.
- Manual review confirms expected values for metadata properties.
- File save operation completes successfully.

## Task: Configure the Apex extension's `package.json`: Add `GitHub.copilot` (or the correct ID) to `extensionDependencies`. [x]

### Step: Search the Visual Studio Code Marketplace or the web to find the exact and current official extension identifier (ID) for the 'GitHub Copilot' extension. Common IDs are often in the format `publisher.extensionName`. Store this confirmed ID for the next step. (ID: `GitHub.copilot`) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The official, unique extension ID for GitHub Copilot is correctly identified.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Verification via VS Code Marketplace listing shows the ID is `GitHub.copilot`.
- The identified ID is stored or noted. (Result: `GitHub.copilot`).

### Step: Locate and open the `package.json` file in the root directory of the VS Code extension project we are currently working on. (`apex/package.json`) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The target `package.json` file (`apex/package.json`) is open in an editor.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Editor shows the content of `apex/package.json`.

### Step: In the `package.json` file, locate the `extensionDependencies` field. If it doesn't exist, add it as a top-level key. Ensure this field is an array of strings. Add the confirmed GitHub Copilot extension ID (found in step 1) as a string element to this array. If the array already exists, append the ID to it, ensuring no duplicates. [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `extensionDependencies` array exists in `package.json`.
- The array contains the string `GitHub.copilot`.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection of `package.json` confirms the `extensionDependencies` key exists.
- Its value is an array.
- The array includes the element `"GitHub.copilot"`.
- No duplicate entries of `"GitHub.copilot"` exist in the array.

### Step: Verify that the `extensionDependencies` array in `package.json` now correctly includes the GitHub Copilot extension ID. Save the changes made to the `package.json` file. [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `package.json` file is syntactically valid JSON.
- The `extensionDependencies` array correctly includes `GitHub.copilot`.
- The file is saved.
#### Validation Metrics:
- JSON validation/linting passes.
- Inspection confirms `"GitHub.copilot"` is in the `extensionDependencies` array.
- File save operation completes successfully.

## Task: Configure the Apex extension's `package.json`: Add the identified Copilot `activationEvents` and `onView:<copilot_view_id>`. [x]

### Step: Open the `package.json` file located in the root directory of the new VS Code extension project you are working on. (`apex/package.json`) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The target `package.json` file (`apex/package.json`) is open in an editor.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Editor shows the content of `apex/package.json`.

### Step: Locate the `activationEvents` array within the `package.json` file. If this key does not exist, add it as a top-level key with an empty array `[]` as its value. [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `activationEvents` key exists in `package.json` and its value is a JSON array.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection of `package.json` confirms the `activationEvents` key exists.
- The value associated with `activationEvents` is verified to be an array.

### Step: Retrieve the list of activation events previously identified from the GitHub Copilot extension's `package.json`. Add each of these event strings to the `activationEvents` array in your extension's `package.json`. Avoid adding duplicate entries if any events already exist in the array. (Added `onStartupFinished`) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `activationEvents` array in `apex/package.json` includes the events identified from Copilot's `package.json` (e.g., `onStartupFinished`).
- No duplicate activation events are present in the array.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection of the `activationEvents` array confirms the presence of `"onStartupFinished"`.
- Verification that the array does not contain duplicates of this event.

### Step: Retrieve the specific view ID identified for the GitHub Copilot panel (e.g., `github.copilot.panel`). Construct a new activation event string in the format `onView:<copilot_view_id>`, replacing `<copilot_view_id>` with the actual ID you found. Add this `onView:` string to the `activationEvents` array in your `package.json`. Avoid adding a duplicate if this specific `onView:` event already exists. (Added `onView:GitHub Copilot Suggestions`) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `activationEvents` array includes the specific `onView:` event corresponding to the identified Copilot view ID (`onView:GitHub Copilot Suggestions`).
- No duplicate of this specific `onView:` event exists in the array.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection of the `activationEvents` array confirms the presence of `"onView:GitHub Copilot Suggestions"`.
- Verification that the array does not contain duplicates of this event.

### Step: Verify that the `activationEvents` array now contains both the events copied from Copilot and the specific `onView:<copilot_view_id>` event. Ensure the entire `package.json` file is still valid JSON format. Hint: Use a JSON validator or the editor's built-in linting if available. [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `activationEvents` array contains all intended events (`onStartupFinished`, `onView:GitHub Copilot Suggestions`).
- The `package.json` file is syntactically valid JSON.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the presence of all required strings in the `activationEvents` array.
- JSON validation/linting passes on the `package.json` file.

### Step: Save the modified `package.json` file. [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The changes to `package.json` (specifically `activationEvents`) are persisted to disk.
#### Validation Metrics:
- File save operation completes successfully.
- Timestamp of `package.json` is updated.

## Task: Configure the Apex extension's `package.json`: Add a view contribution using the *exact same view ID* and *view container* identified from Copilot. [x]

### Step: Access the `package.json` file located in the root directory of the interceptor extension project you created in the previous steps. (`apex/package.json`) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The target `package.json` file (`apex/package.json`) is open in an editor.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Editor shows the content of `apex/package.json`.

### Step: Confirm the exact GitHub Copilot view ID and view container ID identified in the previous analysis phase. Assume the view ID is stored as `COPILOT_VIEW_ID` (e.g., 'github.copilot.panel') and the container ID as `COPILOT_VIEW_CONTAINER_ID` (e.g., 'copilot' or 'activitybar'). If these values are uncertain, re-inspect the Copilot extension or use VS Code's 'Developer: Inspect Context Keys' command targeting the Copilot panel area to verify them before proceeding. (View ID: `GitHub Copilot Suggestions`, Container: `claude-dev-ActivityBar`) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The correct values for the target view ID (`GitHub Copilot Suggestions`) and the target view container (`claude-dev-ActivityBar`) are confirmed and available.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Variables or documented values for `COPILOT_VIEW_ID` and `COPILOT_VIEW_CONTAINER_ID` match the specified values.
- If uncertainty existed, confirmation that re-inspection yielded these values.

### Step: Locate the `contributes` section within the `package.json` file. If it does not exist, create it as an empty JSON object: `"contributes": {}`. [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `contributes` key exists in `package.json` and its value is a JSON object.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the presence and type of the `contributes` key in `package.json`.

### Step: Within the `contributes` object, locate the `views` object. If it does not exist, create it as an empty JSON object: `"views": {}`. [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `views` key exists within the `contributes` object, and its value is a JSON object.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the presence and type of the `contributes.views` key/value pair.

### Step: Within the `views` object, add a key corresponding to the `COPILOT_VIEW_CONTAINER_ID`. The value associated with this key must be a JSON array. If the key already exists, ensure its value is an array. Example: `"copilot": []` (replace `copilot` with the actual `COPILOT_VIEW_CONTAINER_ID`). (Used existing `claude-dev-ActivityBar`) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- A key matching the chosen container ID (`claude-dev-ActivityBar`) exists within `contributes.views`.
- The value associated with this key is a JSON array.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection confirms the key `claude-dev-ActivityBar` exists under `contributes.views`.
- Verification that the value associated with `claude-dev-ActivityBar` is an array.

### Step: Add a new JSON object to the array identified in the previous step. This object represents your interceptor view panel. Configure this object with the following properties: [x]
  - `id`: Set this to the exact value of `COPILOT_VIEW_ID`. (`GitHub Copilot Suggestions`)
  - `name`: Set this to a descriptive name, such as "Apex Interceptor" or "Apex Panel". (Set to "CodeGen")
#### Success Criteria:
- A JSON object is added to the `contributes.views['claude-dev-ActivityBar']` array.
- This object contains the correct `id` ("GitHub Copilot Suggestions") and `name` ("CodeGen") properties.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Inspection of the `claude-dev-ActivityBar` array confirms the presence of a new object.
- Verification that this object has an `id` property with value `"GitHub Copilot Suggestions"`.
- Verification that this object has a `name` property with value `"CodeGen"`.

### Step: Review the changes made to the `contributes.views` section to ensure the structure is correct and matches the identified Copilot IDs precisely. Ensure there are no other view contributions within your extension's `package.json` that conflict with this registration. [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The `contributes.views` structure correctly defines the interceptor view with the target ID and container.
- There are no conflicting view registrations in the file.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Manual review confirms the `contributes.views['claude-dev-ActivityBar']` array contains the object with the correct `id` and `name`.
- Review confirms no other view definitions use the ID `"GitHub Copilot Suggestions"`.

### Step: Save the modified `package.json` file. *Hint:* Consider using a JSON linter or formatter to ensure the file remains valid and readable. [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The changes to `package.json` (view contribution) are persisted.
- The file remains valid JSON.
#### Validation Metrics:
- File save operation completes successfully.
- JSON validation/linting passes on the saved file.
