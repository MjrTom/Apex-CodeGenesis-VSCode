# Core Integration Phase 1: VS Code Source Analysis

## Goal: Analyze VS Code source structure to prepare for core integration of Apex sidebar, ensuring modularity.

## Task: Build and run the modified Apex extension alongside GitHub Copilot to verify it activates correctly and takes precedence, effectively blocking/replacing the default Copilot panel. [x] (Verified visually and via console check)

### Step: Compile the interceptor extension's TypeScript code into JavaScript. Use the standard build command configured in your `package.json` (e.g., `npm run compile` or `tsc -p ./`). Ensure there are no compilation errors. (User confirmed build success) [x]
#### Success Criteria:
- The TypeScript code in the `src` directory is successfully compiled into JavaScript in the `out` or `dist` directory.
- The compilation process completes without errors.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Build command (`npm run compile`, `tsc`, etc.) exit code is 0.
- No error messages are output during compilation.
- JavaScript files (`.js` and `.js.map`) exist in the output directory corresponding to the `.ts` source files.

### Step: Prepare to launch the VS Code Extension Development Host. Ensure that the GitHub Copilot extension is installed and enabled in your main VS Code instance, as the Development Host inherits these extensions. [x] (Verified via screenshot)
#### Success Criteria:
- The main VS Code instance has the GitHub Copilot extension installed and enabled.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Check the Extensions view in the main VS Code instance: GitHub Copilot is listed under 'Enabled'.

### Step: Launch the Extension Development Host instance by pressing F5 or using the 'Run and Debug' view (select 'Run Extension'). [x] (Verified via screenshot showing '[Extension Development Host]' title)
#### Success Criteria:
- A new VS Code window (the Extension Development Host) opens, running the modified Apex extension code.
#### Validation Metrics:
- A new VS Code window appears.
- The Debug Console in the main VS Code window shows output indicating the extension host started.

### Step: In the newly opened Extension Development Host window, locate the view container where the GitHub Copilot panel typically resides (e.g., Activity Bar, Explorer sidebar). Attempt to open or focus the panel associated with the Copilot View ID you previously identified (e.g., `github.copilot.panel`). [x] (Verified via screenshot showing Apex view active)
#### Success Criteria:
- The UI element corresponding to the view ID `GitHub Copilot Suggestions` is located and activated within the Extension Development Host.
#### Validation Metrics:
- The view container specified in `package.json` (`claude-dev-ActivityBar`) is visible.
- Clicking the icon or running a command associated with the `GitHub Copilot Suggestions` view results in a panel/view appearing in that container.

### Step: Verify visually that the panel displayed is *not* the standard GitHub Copilot interface. It might be blank or show very basic content depending on the current placeholder implementation. The key is that Copilot's UI is blocked. [x] (Verified via screenshot showing Apex UI)
#### Success Criteria:
- The content displayed in the panel associated with the `GitHub Copilot Suggestions` ID is controlled by the Apex extension's `WebviewProvider`, not the default Copilot UI.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Visual inspection confirms the panel shows the Apex webview content (or the placeholder HTML if that was used) instead of the usual Copilot interface.

### Step: Open the Developer Tools in the Extension Development Host (`Developer: Toggle Developer Tools`). Check the Console tab for any errors, particularly messages indicating view registration conflicts or activation problems for either your interceptor extension or GitHub Copilot. [x] (Verified via user-provided console output - no relevant errors)
#### Success Criteria:
- The Developer Tools console shows no errors related to view registration conflicts or activation issues for either extension.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Execute `Developer: Toggle Developer Tools` command successfully.
- Console tab shows no red error messages related to `registerWebviewViewProvider`, activation events, or view ID conflicts.

### Step: Modify your interceptor extension's `extension.ts` file. Add a `console.log` statement inside the `activate` function, immediately after registering the view provider, confirming activation and view registration. For example: `console.log('INFO: Interceptor extension activated and successfully registered view: [Your Copilot View ID]');`. Re-compile the extension. [x] (Added Logger.log statement)
#### Success Criteria:
- A `console.log` statement is added to `activate` function in `extension.ts`.
- The extension code is successfully re-compiled.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Code change is saved in `extension.ts`.
- Build command completes without errors.
- Updated JavaScript files are generated.

### Step: Re-launch the Extension Development Host (F5). Open the Extension Host logs (`Developer: Show Logs...` -> `Extension Host`). Verify that your custom log message from the previous step appears, confirming successful activation and registration precedence. [x] (Verified via user confirmation and logs)
#### Success Criteria:
- The custom log message added in the previous step appears in the Extension Host logs, indicating the Apex `activate` function ran and registered the view provider for the target ID.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Extension Development Host launches successfully.
- Execute `Developer: Show Logs...` -> `Extension Host` command successfully.
- The specific log message (e.g., 'INFO: Interceptor extension activated...') is found within the log output.

### Step: If you have implemented a basic `WebViewViewProvider` for the interceptor panel, modify its `resolveWebviewView` method to set simple, identifiable HTML content. For example: `webviewView.webview.html = '<h1>Interceptor Active</h1><p>Copilot panel replaced.</p>';`. Re-compile the extension. [x] (Added placeholder HTML to WebviewProvider)
#### Success Criteria:
- The `resolveWebviewView` method in `WebviewProvider` is updated to provide distinct placeholder HTML.
- The extension is successfully re-compiled.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Code change is saved in `extension.ts`.
- Build command completes without errors.
- Updated JavaScript files are generated.

### Step: Re-launch the Extension Development Host (F5). Open the intercepted panel again and confirm that the placeholder HTML content (e.g., 'Interceptor Active') is displayed. This visually confirms your extension is providing the content for the claimed view ID. [x] (Verified via user confirmation and screenshot)
#### Success Criteria:
- The panel associated with the `GitHub Copilot Suggestions` ID displays the specific placeholder HTML content set in the previous step.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Extension Development Host launches successfully.
- Activating the target view panel displays the exact HTML (e.g., showing the 'Interceptor Active' heading).
- Visual confirmation that the default Copilot UI is not shown.
