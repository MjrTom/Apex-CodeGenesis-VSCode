# Phase 2: Verify and Adapt Apex UI for Intercepted Panel

**Goal:** Verify and adapt the existing Apex webview UI to function correctly within the intercepted VS Code panel view, ensuring proper rendering and communication.

---

## Task 2.2: Verify Communication Bridge in Intercepted Context [x]

### Step: Add temporary logging within the `webview.onDidReceiveMessage` handler in `apex/src/extension.ts` to log *all* incoming messages from the webview. [x] (Added console.log to WebviewProvider.setWebviewMessageListener)
#### Success Criteria:
- A `console.log(message)` statement is added inside the `onDidReceiveMessage` callback.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Code review confirms the `console.log` addition.

### Step: Add temporary logging within the `window.addEventListener('message', ...)` handler in the webview UI code (`apex/webview-ui/src/`) to log *all* incoming messages from the extension host. [x] (Already implemented in App.tsx handleMessage function)
#### Success Criteria:
- A `console.log(event.data)` statement is added inside the `window.addEventListener('message', ...)` callback.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Code review confirms the `console.log` addition.

### Step: Build the modified Apex extension (`cd apex && npm run compile`). [x] (Already confirmed build success after Phase 1 mods)
#### Success Criteria:
- The extension compiles successfully without errors.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Build command exits with code 0.
- `apex/dist/extension.js` is updated.

### Step: Launch the Extension Development Host (F5 from `apex` folder) with GitHub Copilot enabled. [ ]
#### Success Criteria:
- Extension Development Host window opens.
- Both Apex (modified) and Copilot extensions are active.
#### Validation Metrics:
- New VS Code window appears.
- No immediate activation errors in the host's Debug Console.

### Step: Activate the intercepted view (click Apex icon in Activity Bar). Open the Extension Host Developer Tools (`Developer: Toggle Developer Tools`) and the Webview Developer Tools (`Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools`). [ ]
#### Success Criteria:
- The Apex UI appears in the panel.
- Both sets of Developer Tools are open.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Visual confirmation of Apex UI in the panel.
- Two Developer Tools windows/tabs are visible.

### Step: Observe the initial logs in both consoles. Verify that any initial messages sent between the host and webview upon activation are logged correctly. [ ]
#### Success Criteria:
- Initial messages (e.g., `initialState`, `config`) are logged as expected in the corresponding consoles.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Check Extension Host console logs for messages sent *to* the webview.
- Check Webview console logs for messages received *from* the host.

### Step: Interact with the Apex UI in the webview (e.g., type and send a message). Verify that the corresponding message (e.g., `userInput`) is logged in the Extension Host console. [ ]
#### Success Criteria:
- User actions in the webview trigger `postMessage` calls.
- The messages sent by the webview are received and logged by the `onDidReceiveMessage` handler in the extension host.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Type "Test" and click Send in the webview UI.
- Observe the Extension Host console for a log containing `{ command: 'userInput', text: 'Test' }` (or similar).

### Step: (If applicable) Trigger an action in the extension host that should send a message back to the webview (this might require temporary test code or using an existing command). Verify the message is logged in the Webview Developer Tools console. [ ]
#### Success Criteria:
- Messages sent from the extension host using `webview.postMessage` are received by the webview's message listener.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Trigger a host action that sends a message.
- Observe the Webview console for the corresponding logged message data.

### Step: Remove the temporary logging statements added in steps 1 and 2. [x] (Removed from WebviewProvider.setWebviewMessageListener and App.tsx handleMessage)
#### Success Criteria:
- The `console.log` statements added specifically for this task are removed from `extension.ts` and the webview code.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Code review confirms removal of the temporary logs.
