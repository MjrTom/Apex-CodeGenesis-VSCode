# Phase 2: Verify and Adapt Apex UI for Intercepted Panel

**Goal:** Verify and adapt the existing Apex webview UI to function correctly within the intercepted VS Code panel view, ensuring proper rendering and communication.

---

## Task 2.3: Adapt UI/Communication if Necessary (Based on Testing) [x]

### Step: Based on the results of Task 2.2, identify any issues with UI rendering, layout in the panel context, or message passing. [x] (Task 2.2 logs confirm basic communication works. Identified React warnings for unknown props passed to DOM via styled-components. No critical communication or layout issues observed in provided logs.)
#### Success Criteria:
- Any discrepancies between expected and actual behavior during Task 2.2 testing are documented.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Review of Task 2.2 test results identifies specific problems (e.g., UI elements misaligned, messages not received, incorrect message format).

### Step: If layout issues exist, modify the relevant CSS rules in `apex/webview-ui/src/` or component styles to better fit the panel dimensions and VS Code theme. [x] (N/A - No layout issues identified in Task 2.2 logs)
#### Success Criteria:
- CSS code is adjusted to fix identified layout problems.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Code review shows changes to CSS files or style definitions targeting the problematic elements.
- Re-testing (Build + F5 + Visual Check) confirms layout issues are resolved.

### Step: If communication issues exist (messages not sent/received correctly), debug the `postMessage` calls and event listeners in both the extension host (`extension.ts`) and webview (`webview-ui/src/`) code. Ensure the message format matches the expected contract. [x] (N/A - No critical communication issues identified in Task 2.2 logs)
#### Success Criteria:
- Code for sending (`postMessage`) and receiving (`onDidReceiveMessage`, `addEventListener`) messages is corrected.
- Message structures align with the defined contract (`messageTypes.ts` or equivalent).
#### Validation Metrics:
- Code review shows fixes to message sending/receiving logic or message object structures.
- Re-testing (Build + F5 + Console Checks) confirms messages are passed correctly in both directions.

### Step: Re-build the extension (`npm run compile` in `apex` directory) after making any necessary adaptations. [x] (N/A - No adaptations made)
#### Success Criteria:
- The extension compiles successfully after code changes.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Build command exits with code 0.

### Step: Re-run the verification tests from Task 2.2 (Steps 5-8) to confirm the adaptations resolved the identified issues. [x] (N/A - No adaptations made)
#### Success Criteria:
- The previously failed verification steps from Task 2.2 now pass.
- UI renders correctly, and bidirectional communication works as expected.
#### Validation Metrics:
- Repeat Task 2.2 tests: Visual checks and console log checks confirm correct behavior.
