# Task 2.3: Handle Streaming Response

**Status:** Completed

## Goal

Process the streaming response from the language model and update the chat view accordingly.

## Implementation Steps

-   **Process Stream:** Implemented a `for await...of` loop to iterate over `chatResponse.stream`. [X]
-   **Update Chat View:** Used `response.markdown(fragment.content)` within the loop to send text fragments to the chat UI. [X]
-   **Handle Completion:** Added `await chatResponse.result` after the loop to handle the final result promise. [X]
-   **Return Result:** Added `return {}` on successful completion of the stream processing. [X]

## Updates & Status

-   Previously blocked by Task 2.2 (unblocked via workaround).
-   Initial testing resolved the `isTrusted` error but revealed no output was rendered.
-   Added logging which revealed the stream fragment structure is `{ "$mid": ..., "value": "..." }`.
-   Modified the stream handling loop in `agent.ts` to correctly extract text content from `fragment.value`.
-   This task is now considered complete, pending final verification testing.

## Notes

-   The code structure for handling the stream and result is present in `CodeGenesis/src/agent.ts`.
-   Currently assumes only text fragments; logic to handle other fragment types (like tool calls for Phase 3) is marked as a TODO.
