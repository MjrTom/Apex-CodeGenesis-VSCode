# Task 2.4: Basic Error Handling

**Status:** Completed

## Goal

Implement basic error handling for the language model request process.

## Implementation Steps

-   **Wrap in try/catch:** Enclosed the `selectLanguageModels`, `sendChatRequest`, and stream processing logic within a `try...catch` block. [X]
-   **Report Error:** In the `catch` block, used `response.markdown()` to report a generic error message including `error.message` to the chat UI. [X]
-   **Return Error Result:** Returned an `IChatAgentResult` object with the `errorDetails` property set, containing a descriptive message. [X]

## Notes

-   The error handling structure is in place in `CodeGenesis/src/agent.ts`.
-   Currently reports errors via `response.markdown`. Further investigation might reveal a more specific error reporting mechanism via the `response` stream object if available (e.g., `response.error(...)`).
-   The `errorDetails` object correctly includes only the `message` property as required by the type definition.
