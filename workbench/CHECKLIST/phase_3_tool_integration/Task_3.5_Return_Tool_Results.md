# Task 3.5: Return Tool Results to LLM

**Status:** Completed (Initial Implementation)

## Goal

Format the results (or errors) from executed tools and send them back to the LLM so it can generate a final response incorporating the tool's output.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Format Tool Result:**
    *   Created helper `createFunctionResponsePart` in `agent.ts` to format the tool result into the `{ functionResponse: { name: ..., response: { ... } } }` structure expected by the Gemini SDK `Part` type. [X]
    *   Collected these parts into a `functionResponseParts` array within the tool call loop. [X]
2.  **Prepare Follow-up Message History:**
    *   Appended the LLM's turn (containing the function call request) to `currentContents`. [X]
    *   Appended a new `Content` object with `role: 'function'` and the `functionResponseParts` array to `currentContents`. (Corrected from previous attempt). [X]
3.  **Make Follow-up API Call:**
    *   The existing loop structure naturally sends the updated `currentContents` (now including the function response) back to `model.generateContentStream` in the next iteration. [X]
    *   Ensured `tools` definition is only passed on the first round (`toolRound === 0`). [X]
4.  **Process Final Response Stream:**
    *   The existing stream processing logic handles the final text response after the tool results are processed by the LLM. [X]
5.  **Refactor Control Flow:** Implemented a `for` loop (`toolRound`) to handle the potential multi-step interaction (up to 5 rounds). [X]

## Notes

-   Used `as any` cast for tool definition `parameters` to bypass complex `SchemaType` validation error. The underlying type issue should be revisited if possible.
-   The logic correctly adds the function response back to the conversation history using the `{ role: 'function', parts: [...] }` structure.

## Next Steps

-   Verify tool integration through testing.
-   Update main checklist and knowledge graph.
