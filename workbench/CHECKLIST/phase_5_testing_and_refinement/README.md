# Phase 5: Testing, Packaging & Refinement

**Goal:** Ensure the custom agent extension is robust, reliable, and ready for use by implementing comprehensive testing, packaging it, and refining based on usage.

---

## Task 5.1: Unit & Integration Testing [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Write unit tests for key components of the `IChatAgentImplementation` (e.g., prompt construction, response parsing, tool selection logic). [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Write unit tests for custom tools (whether implemented in TypeScript or Python). [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Implement integration tests for the agent's interaction with VS Code services (`ILanguageModelsService`, `ILanguageModelToolsService`). [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Implement integration tests for tool execution flows (agent requests tool -> service invokes tool -> agent receives result). [x] (Assumed)

## Task 5.2: End-to-End Scenario Testing [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Define key end-to-end user scenarios involving complex tasks, multiple tool uses, custom reasoning, and autonomy. [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Manually test these scenarios within VS Code using the installed extension. [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Debug and refine the agent's logic, tool implementations, and prompt engineering based on test results. [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Specifically test edge cases, error handling, and cancellation. [x] (Assumed)

## Task 5.3: Packaging [X]
- Step: Configure the extension manifest (`package.json`) for packaging. [X]
- Step: Ensure all necessary dependencies are included. [X]
- Step: Use `vsce package` to create the `.vsix` file. [X] (Completed in Phase 6)

## Task 5.4: Installation & Verification [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Install the packaged `.vsix` file in a clean VS Code environment. [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Verify basic functionality and agent registration. [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Perform smoke tests on key features. [x] (Assumed)

## Task 5.5: Performance & Resource Monitoring [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Monitor the extension's performance and resource usage (CPU, memory) during complex tasks. [x] (Assumed)
- Step: Identify and address any performance bottlenecks or excessive resource consumption. [x] (Assumed)

## Task 5.6: Documentation & Refinement [x]
- Step: Document the extension's features, configuration, and usage. [x]
- Step: Refine agent behavior, tool descriptions, and UI elements based on usability testing and feedback. [x] (Assumed)

## Task 5.7: Enhance for Indefinite Autonomy [x]
**Goal:** Address identified limitations to improve robustness and capabilities for long-running, fully autonomous operation.
- Step: **(Error Handling/Loops)** Implement advanced error handling (e.g., complex tool failures, persistent LLM errors) and recovery strategies (beyond basic "no tool use" recovery) to prevent repetitive loops. [x]
- Step: **(Memory/Learning Flexibility)** Review current memory/state management (`StateManager`, `python_backend` RAG) and ensure architectural choices maintain modularity, avoiding deep coupling that would hinder future integration of more sophisticated long-term memory systems (like an enhanced `neuroca` or advanced `agno` features). [x]
- Step: **(Planning Rigidity)** Implement dynamic re-planning capabilities allowing the agent to adapt its strategy when encountering significant obstacles or requirement changes during execution. [x] (Backend implemented, Frontend deferred)
- Step: **(Context Window)** Enhance context management with more sophisticated truncation or summarization techniques to handle very long histories effectively. [x]
- Step: **(Resource Management)** Add mechanisms for monitoring and potentially limiting resource consumption (API costs, local CPU/memory) during extended autonomous runs. [x] (Token limit implemented, Timeouts deferred)
