Subject: Diagnose and Resolve Python Backend Connection Failures

**C. Directive Section:**
Execute the following plan sequentially to diagnose and resolve the Python backend connection failures reported in the Extension Host logs. Adherence to the **Apex Software Compliance Standards Guide** (located at `../apex/STANDARDS.md` relative to the prompt template's directory) is **MANDATORY** for all analysis, implementation, and verification steps. Proceed through Phases, Tasks, and Steps strictly in order, marking each checkbox (`- [x]`) only upon successful completion and verification of its `Internal Success Criteria`. Log all findings and test results internally as specified in the `Test Reporting Protocol`. Autonomous execution is required; report only upon completion of all phases or if an unrecoverable blocker is encountered.

**D. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal):**
*   **Log File:** `dev/Backend_Connection_Debug_Log.md` (Create if not present)
*   **Format:** Append entries with:
    *   Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
    *   Phase/Task/Step Reference
    *   Action/Analysis Performed
    *   Findings/Observations/Errors Encountered
    *   Verification Result (Pass/Fail)
*   **Update Frequency:** After each Step involving analysis or verification.

**E. Hierarchical Execution Blocks:**

- [ ] **Phase 1: Diagnostics**
    *   **Objective:** Identify the root cause of the backend connection failure and process exit.
    - [ ] **Task 1.1: Analyze Backend Logs**
        *   **Task Objective:** Find specific error messages or tracebacks within the Python backend logs that indicate the reason for failure.
        - [ ] * **Step 1.1.1 [(Rule #11: LOG-ANALYSIS)]:** Examine the contents of `python_backend/logs/backend_stderr.log` (and any other relevant `.log` files in that directory) for Python exceptions, tracebacks, or error messages occurring around the time of the connection failure or process exit (exit code 1).
        - [ ] * **Step 1.1.2 [(Rule #11: LOG-SYNTHESIS)]:** Document any significant findings (errors, warnings, unusual messages) in the internal log file (`dev/Backend_Connection_Debug_Log.md`).
        *   **Internal Success Criteria:** All relevant backend log files have been examined, and significant findings related to the crash/connection failure are documented.
        *   **Internal Verification Method:** Review the internal log file (`dev/Backend_Connection_Debug_Log.md`) to confirm Steps 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 were completed and findings are recorded. Verify compliance with all referenced Apex Standards Rules for this Task and its Steps.
        *   **Task Completion Testing (Internal):** N/A (Analysis Task)
    - [ ] **Task 1.2: Analyze Backend Communicator (TypeScript)**
        *   **Task Objective:** Understand how the Extension Host spawns, communicates with, and handles errors from the Python backend process.
        - [ ] * **Step 1.2.1 [(Rule #8: QUAL-READ), (Rule #19: IMPL-COMM)]:** Read and analyze the code in `src/core/task/modules/backend-communicator.ts`. Focus specifically on:
            *   The method used to spawn the Python process (`child_process.spawn` or similar).
            *   Arguments passed to the Python script.
            *   Setup of stdin/stdout/stderr streams and the JSON-RPC connection (`vscode-jsonrpc`).
            *   Event listeners for process `error`, `exit`, and `close`.
            *   Logic within `shutdownBackend` and how `connection.dispose()` is called.
            *   Error handling around the RPC connection and process lifecycle.
        - [ ] * **Step 1.2.2 [(Rule #19: IMPL-LOGIC)]:** Identify potential race conditions, unhandled errors, or incorrect logic in the process management and communication setup based on the logs (`Pending response rejected since connection got disposed`).
        - [ ] * **Step 1.2.3 [(Rule #11: LOG-SYNTHESIS)]:** Document findings regarding the communicator's logic and potential issues in the internal log file.
        *   **Internal Success Criteria:** The `backend-communicator.ts` code related to process spawning, communication, and error handling has been fully analyzed, and potential issues are documented.

            *   Establishment of the input/output streams for JSON-RPC.
            *   The main execution loop or server listening logic.
            *   Top-level error handling (try/except blocks).
            *   Any explicit `sys.exit()` calls.
        - [ ] * **Step 1.3.2 [(Rule #8: QUAL-READ), (Rule #19: IMPL-HANDLER)]:** Briefly review Python handlers (`python_backend/src/handlers.py`) for any obvious initialization errors or blocking operations that might occur early.
        - [ ] * **Step 1.3.3 [(Rule #11: LOG-SYNTHESIS)]:** Document findings regarding the Python script's initialization, communication setup, and potential exit points in the internal log file.

        *   **Task Completion Testing (Internal):** Run linters/static analysis on modified files. Update `dev/Backend_Connection_Debug_Log.md` with results.
    - [ ] **Task 2.2: Verify Backend Connection Stability**
        *   **Task Objective:** Confirm that the implemented fix resolves the connection errors and the backend runs stably.
        - [ ] * **Step 2.2.1 [(Rule #14: TEST-EXECUTE), (Rule #19: IMPL-VERIFY)]:** Relaunch the VS Code extension in debug mode or reload the window to restart the extension host and backend process.
        - [ ] * **Step 2.2.2 [(Rule #11: LOG-MONITOR), (Rule #14: TEST-OBSERVE)]:** Closely monitor the Extension Host logs and `python_backend/logs/backend_stderr.log` for any recurrence of the "connection got disposed" errors, "process exited with code 1" messages, or other related errors during startup and initial operation.
        - [ ] * **Step 2.2.3 [(Rule #14: TEST-FUNCTIONAL)]:** Perform a basic functional test: attempt to initiate a simple task in the Apex IDE chat view that requires backend interaction. Observe if it completes successfully without backend errors.
        - [ ] * **Step 2.2.4 [(Rule #11: LOG-RESULT)]:** Document the verification results (success or failure, any observed errors) in the internal log file.
        *   **Internal Success Criteria:** The extension starts, the backend connection is established without "connection disposed" errors, the backend process does not exit unexpectedly (code 1), and a basic functional test completes successfully. Compliance with all referenced Apex Standards Rules.
