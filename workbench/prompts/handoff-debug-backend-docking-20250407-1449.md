# Session Handoff: Debug Apex IDE Backend & Docking Issues v1.1.0

## B. Subject Line:
Subject: [SESSION HANDOFF] Resolve Python Backend Initialization and View Docking Failures

## C. Directive Section
*   **Objective:** Diagnose and resolve the root causes preventing the Apex IDE Python backend from initializing (`AttributeError`, `NameError` in `handlers.py`) and the extension view from docking correctly in the Activity Bar. Restore full extension functionality.
*   **Execution Mode:** Autonomous (Requires ACT MODE).
*   **Sequential Execution:** Mandatory. Follow Phase/Task/Step hierarchy defined in Section E. Mark checkboxes (`- [x]`) only upon successful verification of `Internal Success Criteria` using the `Internal Verification Method`.
*   **Apex Standards:** Adherence to `../apex/STANDARDS.md` (relative to `STANDARDS_REPOSITORY/prompt-templates/`) is **MANDATORY**. Focus on `QUAL-BUGFIX` (Rule #21), `QUAL-ROBUST` (Rule #20), `TEST-UNIT` (Rule #30), `IMPL-CORRECT` (Rule #61), `CONF-VERIFY` (Rule #13).
*   **Reporting:** Disabled until final completion or unrecoverable error.
*   **Internal Logging:** Log test/verification results per `Test Reporting Protocol` (Section D).
*   **Handoff Context:** Previous session attempted fixes for Python backend errors (`AttributeError`, `NameError` in `handlers.py`) via `write_to_file` and configured Activity Bar docking (`package.json`). Direct backend execution (`python -m src.main`) still fails with the same errors post-fix. Docking status after reload is unconfirmed but reported unchanged by the user. Dependencies are installed in `venv`.

## D. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)
*   **Location:** `codegenesis/docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md`
*   **Data Points:** Date/Time, Scope (e.g., "Backend Error Resolution Test", "Docking Verification"), Pass/Fail Status, Error Details (if Fail), Findings/Notes.
*   **Frequency:** After each backend execution test (Task 1.2) and final verification (Phase 2).

## E. Hierarchical Execution Blocks (Next Steps)
---
- [ ] **Phase 1: Resolve Backend Runtime Errors**
    *   **Objective:** Ensure `codegenesis/python_backend/src/main.py` can be executed successfully as a module without runtime errors in `handlers.py`.
    - [ ] **Task 1.1: Correct `handlers.py` Errors**
        *   **Task Objective:** Apply and verify fixes for the `AttributeError` and `NameError` identified in `handlers.py`.
        - [ ] * **Step 1.1.1:** Read `codegenesis/python_backend/src/handlers.py` to get the current code state. (Rule #61: IMPL-CORRECT)
        - [ ] * **Step 1.1.2:** Analyze line ~101: Verify `knowledge_config = config_loader.config` is present. Read `codegenesis/python_backend/src/utils/config_loader.py` to verify the `ConfigLoader` class actually provides a `.config` attribute containing the loaded configuration dictionary. If not, identify the correct access method (e.g., a `get_full_config()` method or similar) and update line ~101 in `handlers.py` accordingly. (Rule #21: QUAL-BUGFIX)
        - [ ] * **Step 1.1.3:** Analyze `METHOD_MAP` definitions: Ensure only the *final* definition block exists (around line 453 in the last known version). Verify this final definition includes all necessary handlers: `handle_initialize`, `handle_execute_task`, `handle_update_configuration`, `handle_tool_response`, `handle_shutdown`, `handle_generate_plan`, `handle_refine_steps`, `handle_select_persona`, `handle_analyze_and_recover`, `handle_get_persona_content_by_name`, `handle_replanning`, `handle_knowledge_search`. Confirm all these handler functions are defined *before* the `METHOD_MAP` assignment. (Rule #21: QUAL-BUGFIX), (Rule #19: QUAL-DRY)
        - [ ] * **Step 1.1.4:** Apply necessary corrections to `handlers.py` using `replace_in_file`. Use precise SEARCH blocks. (Rule #61: IMPL-CORRECT)
        *   **Internal Success Criteria:** `handlers.py` is syntactically correct; `config_loader` usage is valid; only one `METHOD_MAP` definition exists containing all required handlers, placed after handler function definitions. Compliance with all referenced Apex Standards Rules.
        *   **Internal Verification Method:** Read `codegenesis/python_backend/src/handlers.py` and manually inspect for corrected `config_loader` usage and single, complete `METHOD_MAP` definition in the correct location. Verify compliance with all referenced Apex Standards Rules for this Task and its Steps.
        *   **Task Completion Testing (Internal):** Log findings regarding `handlers.py` corrections to `codegenesis/docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md`.
    - [ ] **Task 1.2: Test Backend Execution**
        *   **Task Objective:** Verify the Python backend initializes without the previously identified runtime errors when run directly.
        - [ ] * **Step 1.2.1:** Execute the backend directly: `cd codegenesis\dist\python_backend; python -m src.main` (Rule #30: TEST-UNIT)
        - [ ] * **Step 1.2.2:** Analyze output. If execution fails with the *same* `AttributeError` or `NameError`, revisit Task 1.1 (potentially using `write_to_file` for `handlers.py` if `replace_in_file` fails again). If it fails with *new* errors, log them and proceed to diagnose the new errors (potentially requiring new Phases/Tasks). If successful (no tracebacks related to previous errors, logs indicate initialization started/completed), mark Task 1.2 complete.
        *   **Internal Success Criteria:** Command `python -m src.main` executes from `dist/python_backend` without `AttributeError` related to `config_loader.get_config` or `NameError` related to `METHOD_MAP` handlers.
        *   **Internal Verification Method:** Execute command in Step 1.2.1 and check `stderr`/`stdout` for the specific tracebacks seen previously.
        *   **Task Completion Testing (Internal):** Update `codegenesis/docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` with backend execution results (Pass/Fail, Error Details).
- [ ] **Phase 2: Verify Extension Functionality**
    *   **Objective:** Confirm the extension loads correctly in VS Code, the view docks properly, and the backend initializes successfully enabling chat functionality.
    - [ ] **Task 2.1: Reload VS Code**
        *   **Task Objective:** Ensure VS Code picks up changes in `package.json` and attempts to load the updated extension code.
        - [ ] * **Step 2.1.1:** Request user to reload VS Code ("Developer: Reload Window").
        *   **Internal Success Criteria:** User confirms VS Code reload is complete.
        *   **Internal Verification Method:** User confirmation via follow-up question.
        *   **Task Completion Testing (Internal):** Log confirmation of reload request.
    - [ ] **Task 2.2: Verify Docking and Backend Initialization**
        *   **Task Objective:** Confirm both the UI docking and backend initialization are successful within the VS Code environment.
        - [ ] * **Step 2.2.1:** Ask user to confirm if the Apex icon appears correctly in the Activity Bar.
        - [ ] * **Step 2.2.2:** Ask user to open the Apex view and confirm if backend initialization errors (e.g., "process stopped unexpectedly", "write EPIPE", "connection disposed") are gone from the UI.
        - [ ] * **Step 2.2.3:** Ask user to test basic chat functionality (e.g., send "hello") and report if it works.
        *   **Internal Success Criteria:** Apex icon present in Activity Bar; No Python backend initialization errors in Apex view; Basic chat interaction successful.
        *   **Internal Verification Method:** User confirmation via follow-up questions for steps 2.2.1, 2.2.2, and 2.2.3.
        *   **Task Completion Testing (Internal):** Update `codegenesis/docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` with verification results for docking, backend status, and chat functionality.
    - [ ] **Task 2.3: Address Remaining Issues (Conditional)**
        *   **Task Objective:** Diagnose and fix any persistent docking or backend issues observed within the VS Code environment.
        - [ ] * **Step 2.3.1:** If docking still fails (Step 2.2.1 negative), re-examine `package.json` (`viewsContainers`, `views`, icon path `assets/icons/icon.svg`). Check for potential conflicts with other extensions or VS Code settings. (Rule #13: CONF-VERIFY)
        - [ ] * **Step 2.3.2:** If backend still fails within VS Code (Step 2.2.2 negative) *despite* successful direct execution (Task 1.2 positive), investigate VS Code environment differences. Check "Apex" output channel logs (`codegenesis/src/extension.ts` creates this) for detailed errors during extension activation or backend spawning. Consider PATH or environment variable issues specific to the VS Code extension host process. (Rule #21: QUAL-BUGFIX)
        - [ ] * **Step 2.3.3:** Implement and test fixes for any identified issues, potentially looping back to Task 1.1 or creating new tasks. (Rule #61: IMPL-CORRECT)
        *   **Internal Success Criteria:** Root cause of any remaining docking or backend issues identified and resolved. Extension fully functional.
        *   **Internal Verification Method:** Re-run relevant verification steps from Task 2.2 after applying fixes. Check output channel logs.
        *   **Task Completion Testing (Internal):** Log findings and results of any additional fixes.

## F. Final Instruction
Begin execution with Phase 1, Task 1.1 upon entering ACT MODE. Prioritize resolving the runtime errors in `handlers.py`. Proceed sequentially through Phases, Tasks, and Steps, marking checkboxes only upon successful verification against `Internal Success Criteria` using the specified `Internal Verification Method`. Adhere strictly to all referenced Apex Standards (`../apex/STANDARDS.md`). Update the internal log (`codegenesis/docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md`) as required by `Task Completion Testing`. Report only upon successful completion of all phases or if an unrecoverable error is encountered.
